/* I fixed the syntax errors.
 * I changed "!== null" to "!== undefined" because null is a non value and it must time must not be undefined/unknown.
 * I changed the equality operator to a strict equality for 'hourofDay' and 'minuteofDay' from "== '00'" to "=== 0" to increase predictability of time.
 * I fixed the spelling error in 'starting' to 'StartingafterTax'
 * I formatted the final balance by adding the "R" currency and using the 'toFix(2) to round off to 2 decimal places
